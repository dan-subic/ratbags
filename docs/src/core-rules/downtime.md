# Downtime

For every week or so spent in a safe locale, a PC gains one **Downtime Action**. A PC can gain multiple **Downtime Actions** by spending multiple weeks in downtime. All **Downtime Actions** accumulated must be spent at once.

A **Downtime Action** can be spent to do any of the following:
* Rest & Recover: All Abilities return to return to maximum, provided a healer is available.
* Train: Gain [1 XP](/core-rules/advancement.html)
* Work Odd Jobs: Gain 3d6 gold
* Any other reasonable action that would take about a week to accomplish.

At the Referee's discretion, lengthy acts could require multiple **Downtime Actions** to accomplish.

It's also possible to do things that take up only a short amount of time (< 1 day) during downtime, such as purchasing standard equipment. 
This _doesn't_ require the use of a **Downtime Action** due to the relatively short amount of time spent.
