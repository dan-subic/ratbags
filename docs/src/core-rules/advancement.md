# Advancement

## Triggers

At the end of each session, the Referee asks each player the following.

Did your character...
* Show a focused, consistent pattern of behavior around a single objective or course of action?
* Take an obvious risk with potentially serious consequences, especially when the outcome is unknown?
* Interact with a unique item, creature, or entity?

If 2/3 of the above happened, that character gets weirder, in a way determined by the Referee.


## Alternate

At the end of each session, each PC played receives 1 XP. The Referee will ask the players the following questions:
* Did your character survive a deadly situation?
* Did your character recover a valuable treasure?
* Did your character overcome a challenge using cunning or resourcefulness?

For each question a player answers affirmative, the character gains 1 XP.

When a character reaches 8 XP, reset to zero XP and level up. Any excess XP rolls over.

### Levelling Up

When a character levels up, do the following:
* If their HP is 1-4, increase HP by 2. Otherwise, increase HP by 1.
* Roll a d20 for STR, DEX, and WIL. If the result is higher than the maximum for that Attribute, increase the current & maximum for that Attribute by 1.
