# Magic Crafting

In Ratbags!, PCs can make new magic items, known as _Crafts_.

This requires:
* A captured soul or spirit (the _Element_)
* Something to enchant (the _Target_)
* A wizard's enchanting lab & expertise
* Two weeks of time, to allow the enchantment to take

The _Target_ can be any object small enough to hold. Wands are traditional. 

The _Target_ can also be a person's body part (including a PC's). The upside is that a PC can get new powers without carrying an item around. The downsides are that the powers can't be loaned to anyone else, and if something goes wrong, the PC is stuck with the changes.

## Costs

A wizard will typically charge 300g to create a _Craft_ in their lab.

A PC will need to supply their own _Target_ and _Element_- wizards are unlikely to give up their personal supply of spirits. 

A Soul Catcher (1 slot, 120g) can be used to trap adjacent spirits. It looks like a leaden French press, with a gold-plated rod and a hatch on the bottom.


## Procedure

When a _Craft_ is made, the Referee and the PC's player- the Crafter- go down the following list.

1. The Referee and the Crafter agree on what the _Element_ and the _Target_ are.
2. The Referee asks the Crafter- "What new _Power_ does the _Target_ gain?" The Referee can veto.
3. The Referee asks the player to the Crafter's left- "How does the _Target's_ appearance change?"
4. The Crafter asks the Referee: "What's the _Catch_? A cost, a drawback, or a complication?"
5. The Crafter rolls a d6 and consults the following table.

| d6 | Result |
| -- | ------ |
| 1  | The _Element_ was more powerful than anyone anticipated. The Referee makes both the _Power_ and the _Catch_ greater. |
| 2  | The _Craft_ also gains a personality, appropriate to the _Element_ used to enchant it. It has a desire, which is not trivial to satisfy. While the _Craft's_ wielder is pursuing that desire, the _Power_ is greater. While the _Craft_ is denied its desire, the _Catch_ is greater. | 
| 3  | The _Element_ was contaminated. The player to the Crafter's left names the last weird thing the PCs encountered. This is a second _Element_ of the _Craft_. The Referee asks the player to the _Crafter's_ right- "What also happens when the _Craft's_ _Power_ is activated?" The Referee makes the _Catch_ greater. |
| 4-6 | Nothing. It turned out just the way you thought it would! |


## Guidelines

A _Power_ should be a notch or two weaker than the _Element_ it's sourced from.

A _Catch_ should make using the _Power_ interesting to use, by having a meaningful cost or by making its user jump through hoops to get the full value from it.

Alice has decided to enchant a pair of boots with the soul of a vampire. Bob, the Referee, goes down the list. Also at the table are Carol and Dave.

**Bob**: "So, first up, what's the _Element_ and what's the _Target_?

**Alice**: "The vampire is the _Element_ and the boots are the _Target_, right?"

**Bob**: "Right. Next on the list, I ask you this- What new _Power_ does the _Target_ gain?"

**Alice**: "Ok, radical idea- what if anyone who wears the boots turns into a vampire?"

**Bob**: "Hmm, the _Power_ is meant to be weaker than the _Element_ is. Sorry, I think I should veto that."

**Alice**: "Haha, I was expecting that. I have a serious idea. Vampires can walk on walls and ceilings and stuff, right? What if the boots let the wearer do that?"

**Bob**: "That sounds reasonable to me. Ok, next on the list- Carol, how does the _Target's_ appearance change?"

**Carol**: "Black with bat wings, obviously!"

**Bob**: "Obviously. Ok, Alice, you ask me the next question."

**Alice**: "Oh right! Bob, what's the _Catch_? A cost, a drawback, or a complication?"

**Bob**: "Well, boots that let you walk on walls and ceilings sound pretty powerful to me... Ah! Here's a drawback- they only work in the dark. Since they're vampire boots, after all."

**Alice**: "Drat. That does make them harder to use..."

**Bob**: "I'm sure you'll find a good use for them. Ok, Alice, last step- roll a d6 for me."

**Alice**: "... I got a 2. So that means the boots have a personality and a desire."

**Bob**: "Oooh! Well obviously, the boots have a desire to drink human blood."

**Alice**: "Sure. What does that mean for the _Power_ and the _Catch_?"

**Bob**: "Hmmmm, when the boots are thirsty the _Catch_ needs to be greater... in this case I think that means they only work in absolute darkness. But other times, they work in places that are just fairly dark."

**Alice**: "Ok, let's work out the details on that later. What about the _Power_?"

**Bob**: "I'm not sure about a straighforward way to make the _Power_ better. But I was thinking- these boots could be kinda dangerous to use, right? What if you were standing upside-down on a tall ceiling and got yanked down?"

**Alice**: "Yeah, I hadn't thought about that..."

**Bob**: "So what if, when you're pursuing the boots' desire for blood, you can also fall from heights safely? I think that qualifies as making the _Power_ greater."

**Alice**: "Works for me."
