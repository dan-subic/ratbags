# Magic Crafting

In Ratbags!, PCs can make new magic items, known as _Crafts_.

This requires:
* A captured soul or spirit (the _Element_)
* Something to enchant (the _Target_)
* A wizard's enchanting lab & expertise
* Two weeks of time, to allow the enchantment to take

The _Target_ can be any object small enough to hold. Wands are traditional. 

The _Target_ can also be a person's body part (including a PC's). The upside is that a PC can get new powers without carrying an item around. The downsides are that the powers can't be loaned to anyone else, and if something goes wrong, the PC is stuck with the changes.

## Costs

A wizard will typically charge 300g to create a _Craft_ in their lab.

A PC will need to supply their own _Target_ and _Element_- wizards are unlikely to give up their personal supply of spirits. 

A Soul Catcher (1 slot, 120g) can be used to trap adjacent spirits. It looks like a leaden French press, with a gold-plated rod and a hatch on the bottom.


## Procedure

When a _Craft_ is made, the Referee and the PC's player- the Crafter- go down the following list.

1. The Referee and the Crafter agree on what the _Element_ and the _Target_ are.
2. The Referee asks the Crafter- "What new _Power_ does the _Target_ gain?"
3. The Referee asks the player to the Crafter's left- "How does the _Target's_ appearance change?"
4. The Crafter asks the Referee: "What's the _Catch_? A cost, a drawback, or a complication?"
5. The Referee rolls a d6 and consults the following table.

| d6 | Result |
| -- | ------ |
| 1  | The _Element_ was more powerful than anyone anticipated. The Referee makes both the _Power_ and the _Catch_ greater. |
| 2  | The _Craft_ also gains a personality, appropriate to the _Element_ used to enchant it. It has a desire, which is not trivial to satisfy. While the _Craft's_ wielder is pursuing that desire, the _Power_ is greater. While the _Craft_ is denied its desire, the _Catch_ is greater. | 
| 3  | The _Element_ was contaminated. The player to the Crafter's left names the last weird thing the PCs encountered. This is a second _Element_ of the _Craft_. The Referee asks player to the _Crafter's_ right- "What also happens when the _Craft's_ power is activated?" The Referee makes the _Catch_ greater. |
| 4-6 | Nothing. It turned out just the way you thought it would! |
