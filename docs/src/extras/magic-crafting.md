# Magic Crafting

In Ratbags!, PCs can make create magical stuff, collectively called _Crafts_.


There's some other pieces of terminology that will be referred to in the subsequent sections. See the following glossary.
 
| Term          | Definition                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Target_      | The (othewise mundane) thing that's being enchanted                   |
| _Element_     | The thing that's enchanting the _Target_                              |
| _Power_       | The new ability the Target gains in the course of becoming a _Craft_  |
| _Catch_       | A cost, drawback, or complication that comes with using the _Craft_   |

## Overarching Guidelines

A _Power_ should be a notch or two weaker than the _Element_ it's sourced from, unless it's the _Power_ of a Consumable _Craft_.

A _Catch_ should make using the _Power_ interesting to use, by having a meaningful cost or by making its user jump through hoops to get the full value from it.


## Permanent Crafts

### Requirements

Creating a Permanent _Craft_ requires:

* A captured soul or spirit (the _Element_)
* Something to enchant (the _Target_)
* A wizard's enchanting lab & expertise
* Two weeks of time, to allow the enchantment to take

The _Target_ can be any object small enough to hold. Wands are traditional. 

The _Target_ can also be a person's body part (including a PC's). The upside is that a PC can get new powers without carrying an item around. The downsides are that the powers can't be loaned to anyone else, and if something goes wrong, the PC is stuck with the changes.

### Costs

A wizard will typically charge 300g to create a Permanent _Craft_ in their lab.

A PC will need to supply their own _Target_ and _Element_- wizards are unlikely to give up their personal supply of spirits. 

A Soul Catcher (1 slot, 120g) can be used to trap adjacent spirits. It looks like a leaden French press, with a gold-plated rod and a hatch on the bottom.


### Procedure

When a Permanent _Craft_ is made, the Referee and the PC's player- the Crafter- go down the following list.

1. The Referee and the Crafter agree on what the _Element_ and the _Target_ are.
2. The Referee asks the Crafter- "What new _Power_ does the _Target_ gain?" The Referee can veto.
3. The Referee asks the player to the Crafter's left- "How does the _Target's_ appearance change?"
4. The Crafter asks the Referee: "What's the _Catch_? A cost, a drawback, or a complication?"
5. Check for a twist. The Crafter rolls a d6 and consults the following table.

| d6 | Result |
| -- | ------ |
| 1  | The _Element_ was more powerful than anyone anticipated. The Referee makes both the _Power_ and the _Catch_ greater. |
| 2  | The _Craft_ also gains a desire, appropriate to the _Element_ used to enchant it, and not trivial to satisfy. While the _Craft's_ wielder is pursuing that desire, the _Power_ is greater. While the _Craft_ is denied its desire, the _Catch_ is greater. | 
| 3  | The _Element_ was contaminated. The player to the Crafter's left names the last weird thing the PCs encountered. This is a second _Element_ of the _Craft_. The Referee asks the player to the _Crafter's_ right- "What also happens when the _Craft's_ _Power_ is activated?" The Referee makes the _Catch_ greater. |
| 4-6 | Nothing. It turned out just the way you thought it would! |

Alice has decided to enchant a pair of boots with the soul of a vampire. Bob, the Referee, goes down the list. Also at the table are Carol and Dave.

**Bob**: "So, first up, what's the _Element_ and what's the _Target_?

**Alice**: "The vampire is the _Element_ and the boots are the _Target_, right?"

**Bob**: "Right. Next on the list, I ask you this- What new _Power_ does the _Target_ gain?"

**Alice**: "Ok, radical idea- what if anyone who wears the boots turns into a vampire?"

**Bob**: "Hmm, the _Power_ is meant to be weaker than the _Element_ is. Sorry, I think I should veto that."

**Alice**: "Haha, I was expecting that. I have a serious idea. Vampires can walk on walls and ceilings and stuff, right? What if the boots let the wearer do that?"

**Bob**: "That sounds reasonable to me. Ok, next on the list- Carol, how does the _Target's_ appearance change?"

**Carol**: "Black with bat wings, obviously!"

**Bob**: "Obviously. Ok, Alice, you ask me the next question."

**Alice**: "Oh right! Bob, what's the _Catch_? A cost, a drawback, or a complication?"

**Bob**: "Well, boots that let you walk on walls and ceilings sound pretty powerful to me... Ah! Here's a drawback- they only work in the dark. Since they're vampire boots, after all."

**Alice**: "Drat. That does make them harder to use..."

**Bob**: "I'm sure you'll find a good use for them. Ok, Alice, last step- roll a d6 for me."

**Alice**: "... I got a 2. So that means the boots have a desire."

**Bob**: "Oooh! Well obviously, the boots have a desire to drink human blood."

**Alice**: "Sure. What does that mean for the _Power_ and the _Catch_?"

**Bob**: "Hmmmm, when the boots are thirsty the _Catch_ needs to be greater... in this case I think that means they only work in absolute darkness. But other times, they work in places that are just fairly dark."

**Alice**: "Ok, let's work out the details on that later. What about the _Power_?"

**Bob**: "I'm not sure about a straighforward way to make the _Power_ better. But I was thinking- these boots could be kinda dangerous to use, right? What if you were standing upside-down on a tall ceiling and got yanked down?"

**Alice**: "Yeah, I hadn't thought about that..."

**Bob**: "So what if, when you're pursuing the boots' desire for blood, you can also fall from heights safely? I think that qualifies as making the _Power_ greater."

**Alice**: "Works for me."

### Relics

A [**Relic**](/core-rules/magic.html#relics) is a special type of Permanent _Craft_. The main difference is how it's made- where other Permanent _Crafts_ are made in a wizarding lab, a **Relic** ia made by beseeching a powerful spirit.

The requirements for creating a **Relic** are:
* Something to enchant (the _Target_)
* A shrine dedicated to a particular spirit
* A convincing argument as to why the spirit should give you this boon

All other requirements for ordinary Permanent _Crafts_ are waived.

If a spirit chooses to grant you the boon of a **Relic**, the spirit itself is the _Element_. The spirit will be weakened while the **Relic** is away from the shrine; for this reason, the spirit will expect the **Relic** to be returned eventually.

To create a **Relic**, follow the normal procedure for creating a Permanent _Craft_. Instead of rolling for a twist, treat it as if the Crafter had rolled a 2- thus, a **Relic** always has a desire.

> ### Monsters
> Wizards are able to create monsters, using a similar process to creating Crafts. 
> 
> No procedure for making a monster is outlined here. Not because they're incapable of it, but because it's less-than-ideal for PCs.
> * Living creatures are necessarily more complex than inert magic items. As such, the procedure for creating monsters would be more complex.
> * Created monsters can die, risking the player loses their investment.
> * Managing a monster NPC entails extra logisitcal complexity at the table.

## Potions

_The system below is adapted from_ [Naively Simple Alchemy](https://foreignplanets.blogspot.com/2020/07/naively-simple-alchemy.html).

All Potions require 4 things;

1. An **Oil** (1 item slot, provides <ins>adjective</ins>)
2. A **Powder** (1 item slot, provides <ins>noun</ins>/<ins>verb</ins>)
3. A **Catalyst** (1 item slot, provides <ins>potency</ins>)
4. **Alchemical Equipment** (bulky)

### How to make a Potion

All things can be reduced to either **Oils** or **Powders** by use of **Alchemical Equipment**. 
These substances produce a single, unchanging effect based on what they were derived from. Unless very large, most creatures or objects can only be reduced into a single batch of a single ingredient.

At its simplest, **Oils** provide an <ins>adjective</ins> effect and **Powders** denote a particular <ins>verb</ins> or <ins>noun</ins>. 
A single **Oil**, a single **Powder**, and a single **Catalyst** are combined to create a potion, the effects of which are the combination of the <ins>adjective</ins> and <ins>noun</ins>/<ins>verb</ins> and empowered by the <ins>potency</ins>.

**Catalysts** are magical liquids that allow **Oils** and **Powders** to combine into potions. See table below.
| Catalyst Potency | Cost |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Mild             | 50g  |
| Moderate         | 100g |
| Strong           | 200g |

For example, an amateur adventuring alchemist slays two _Blink-Dogs_ and reduces one into an **Oil** and the other into a **Powder** using his **Alchemical Equipment**. 
Using his **Alchemical Equipment**, he is aware of the effect the _Blink-Dog_ **Oil** and _Blink-Dog_ **Powder** will bring to any particular potion. (These effects are improv’d by the Referee)

_Blink-Dog_ **Oil**: <ins>Capricious</ins>

_Blink-Dog_ **Powder**: <ins>Teleport</ins>

Having discovered these effects, he (and the Referee) log the effects into a codified alchemical grimoire for future reference. 
The Alchemist can then combine these with a <ins>Standard</ins> **Catalyst** to make his <ins>Capricious Teleport (moderate)</ins> potion (drinking this potion will cause random teleportation).

### Potion Potency

Potion <ins>Potency</ins> is derived from the **Catalyst** used to distill the potion. 
The Referee ultimately rules for how powerful any potion is. 

Some potions have instantaneous effects while other would work for a duration; take this into account when assigning potion effects. 
It would be best practice for the Referee to record specific potion effects for consistency.

See the below table for suggested scale of a potion's effects based on <ins>Potency</ins>. 

| Potency  | Damage   | Area     | Range             | Duration         | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Mild     | 1d6      | Closet   | Within reach      | 1-10 rounds      |
| Moderate | 1d8-1d10 | Room     | A stone's throw   | 10 mins - 1 hour |
| Strong   | 1d12     | Ballroom | An arrow's flight | 1 day - 1 month  |

Ignore any categories that don't apply to the potion's effect. If multiple categories apply to a potion's effect, only apply <ins>Potency</ins> to one of them, or balance them. 

For example- the <ins>Capricious Teleport (moderate)</ins> potion could apply both Range (how far it makes you teleport) and Duration (how long it makes you teleport randomly for).
Since it's <ins>Potency</ins> is <ins>Moderate</ins>, it could make the user teleport a stone's throw away but only once, or a very short distance repeatedly for a duration of 1 hour. 
Or, it could have an effect somewhere between those extremes; it's up to the Referee.


### Exploitation of Mundane Substances

If players attempt to use incredibly mundane substances (like grass) in their potions, allow them. 
However, reduce the potion’s <ins>Potency</ins> by one step and think very carefully about what effects the **Oil** and **Powder** will give. 
The effects should be niche, dull and not terribly useful.
Also consider the large quantity of the mundane substance the players would have to gather in order to produce an effectual yield of oil/powder. 

Grass for example may yield:

_Grass_ **Oil** = <ins>Wilt/Wilting</ins>

_Grass_ **Powder** = <ins>Grass</ins>

> ### Other Consumables
> Potions are the most popular type of magical consumable. Nonetheless, others exist.
> 
> There are analogous methods to create magical foods, drugs, and so on. These are left unstated for brevity; if the Referee wishes to include methods to allow players to create these, adapt the method for potionmaking outlined above.
