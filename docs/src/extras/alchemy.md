# Alchemy

_The system below is adapted from_ [Naively Simple Alchemy](https://foreignplanets.blogspot.com/2020/07/naively-simple-alchemy.html).

## Requirements

All Potions require 4 things:

1. An **Oil**, which is consumed (1 item slot, provides <ins>adjective</ins>)
2. A **Powder**, which is consumed (1 item slot, provides <ins>noun</ins>/<ins>verb</ins>)
3. A **Catalyst**, which is consumed (light, provides <ins>potency</ins>)
4. **Alchemical Equipment**, which is never consumed (bulky)

A character can do 3 of the following as a Downtime Action:
* Turn something into an **Oil** or a **Powder**
* Create one potion

## Oils, Powders, and Catalysts

All things can be reduced to either **Oils** or **Powders** by use of **Alchemical Equipment**. 
These substances produce a single, unchanging effect based on what they were derived from. Unless very large, most creatures or objects can only be reduced into a single batch of a single ingredient.

At its simplest, **Oils** provide an <ins>adjective</ins> effect and **Powders** denote a particular <ins>verb</ins> or <ins>noun</ins>. 
A single **Oil**, a single **Powder**, and a single **Catalyst** are combined to create a potion, the effects of which are the combination of the <ins>adjective</ins> and <ins>noun</ins>/<ins>verb</ins> and empowered by the <ins>potency</ins>.

**Catalysts** are special minerals that allow **Oils** and **Powders** to combine into potions. They are sold by alchemists. See table below.
| Catalyst Potency | Cost |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Mild             | 50g  |
| Moderate         | 100g |
| Strong           | 200g |

## Example

An amateur adventuring alchemist slays two _Blink-Dogs_ and reduces one into an **Oil** and the other into a **Powder** using his **Alchemical Equipment**. 
Using his **Alchemical Equipment**, he is aware of the effect the _Blink-Dog_ **Oil** and _Blink-Dog_ **Powder** will bring to any particular potion. (These effects are improv’d by the Referee)

_Blink-Dog_ **Oil**: <ins>Capricious</ins>

_Blink-Dog_ **Powder**: <ins>Teleport</ins>

Having discovered these effects, he (and the Referee) log the effects into a codified alchemical grimoire for future reference. 
The Alchemist can then combine these with a <ins>Standard</ins> **Catalyst** to make his <ins>Capricious Teleport (moderate)</ins> potion (drinking this potion will cause random teleportation).

## Addenda

### Potion Potency

Potion <ins>Potency</ins> is derived from the **Catalyst** used to distill the potion. 
The Referee ultimately rules for how powerful any potion is. 

Some potions have instantaneous effects while other would work for a duration; take this into account when assigning potion effects. 
It would be best practice for the Referee to record specific potion effects for consistency.

See the below table for suggested scale of a potion's effects based on <ins>Potency</ins>. 

| Potency  | Damage   | Area     | Range             | Duration         | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Mild     | 1d6      | Closet   | Within reach      | 1-10 rounds      |
| Moderate | 1d8-1d10 | Room     | A stone's throw   | 10 mins - 1 hour |
| Strong   | 1d12     | Ballroom | An arrow's flight | 1 day - 1 month  |

Ignore any categories that don't apply to the potion's effect. If multiple categories apply to a potion's effect, only apply <ins>Potency</ins> to one of them, or balance them. 

For example- the <ins>Capricious Teleport (moderate)</ins> potion could apply both Range (how far it makes you teleport) and Duration (how long it makes you teleport randomly for).
Since it's <ins>Potency</ins> is <ins>Moderate</ins>, it could make the user teleport a stone's throw away but only once, or a very short distance repeatedly for a duration of 1 hour. 
Or, it could have an effect somewhere between those extremes; it's up to the Referee.


### Exploitation of Mundane Substances

If players attempt to use incredibly mundane substances (like grass) in their potions, allow them. 
However, reduce the potion’s <ins>Potency</ins> by one step and think very carefully about what effects the **Oil** and **Powder** will give. 
The effects should be niche, dull and not terribly useful.
Also consider the large quantity of the mundane substance the players would have to gather in order to produce an effectual yield of oil/powder. 

Grass for example may yield:

_Grass_ **Oil** = <ins>Wilt/Wilting</ins>

_Grass_ **Powder** = <ins>Grass</ins>

> #### Other Consumables
> Potions are the most popular type of magical consumable. Nonetheless, others exist.
> 
> There are analogous methods to create magical foods, drugs, and so on. These are left unstated for brevity; if the Referee wishes to include methods to allow players to create these, adapt the method for potionmaking outlined above.
